      Skateboarding was descovered in the early 1950's in California when
      surfers wanted to surf on land when the waves were flat. Without any
      reason theses surfers were called <i>"asphalt surfers"</i>. In 1959 the
      first official skateboard was released at the Roller Derby. Over time
      characteristics on skateboards have been improve to develop new tricks

      The first skateboard was made with a wooden box with wheels attatched to
      the bottom. As the years went by the boxes turned into planks and at two
      spots in the world: California and Hawaii, which was a shorter version of
      a surfboard with metal wheels with no bearings eventually companies
      started producing decks of pressed layers of wood, similiar to skateboards
      today. In this time skating was seen as something fun to do after surfing
